There are many front-end development frameworks like React, Angular, Ionic and Vue. We often encounter blog posts, howtos and 'getting started' manuals where the section that explains the 'create your api' glosses over all the complexities that come with designing, creating and maintaining an API. 

#### Uncompromising
The objective of TransomJS is to be simple enough, so it can be referenced in any howto manual, but not compromise on anything, including security, scalability, deployability, feature-set and maintainability. 


#### Complete Flexibility
As a developer, you can quickly and easily configure existing plugins with a simple javascript object, and get all the functionality from the plugin, without writing all that code. You can also create your own plugins for features and functionality that is not available from existing plugins. 

#### Based on the projects you know
Most importantly, you can always write your own code, with access to all the great components that TransomJS is based on, like Restify, Passport, Mongoose and SocketIO. 

> You'll never get in a situation where you can't deliver on a requirement because you chose TransomJS to develop the API.
