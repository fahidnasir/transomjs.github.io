        <h1>TransomJS - Uncompromising Rapid API development on Node</h1>
        <p>
            TransomJS allows developers to create beautiful REST-APIs with simple metadata. Turn an empty Restify server into a full-fledged API in minutes.
            Need something more? Go ahead, there are lots of built-in integration points and nothing in your way to write your own custom endpoints.

            <blockquote>
              <p>
                TransomJS is a rapid API development framework built on top of Restify. 
                Transom uses metadata to configure pre-built and tested plugins that allow developers to quickly compose services that 'just work'. 
                Transom applications are deployable and scalable anywhere you can run NodeJS.
                Using standard Node libraries like Restify, Mongoose and Passport, you get all the benefits with minimal effort.
                TransomJS is based on plugins from the ground up allowing new ones to be added and existing ones to get modified or replaced.
                <br />
                <br />
                We understand that every application is going to have some special sauce that does 
                not come from the framework and we've made sure it doesn't get in your way!</p>

                TransomJS lets you get going quickly without limiting your ability to do your own thing.
                If you need to connect to your data from multiple applications, or simply add some dynamic 
                content to an otherwise static site. Build the SPA or mobile application
                front-end that you need and let TransomJS supply it with data!                    
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-center">Uncompromising</h3>
            <p>
                Every part of TransomJS is configurable and gets out of your way. 
                If you don't like how something works, use your own module or plugin.
