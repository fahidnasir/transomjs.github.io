# TransomJS
## Uncompromising Rapid API development

### Why TransomJS?
* Rapid Prototyping
* No compromises, work directly with all the great Node projects like Restify, Mongoose, Passport and more.
* Develop locally and host anywhere
* Scale easily in the cloud

## transom-core
Transom-core is a foundation for low-code REST API and realtime server development. Transom applications use metadata to configure pre-built and tested modules that allow developers to quickly piece together services that 'just work'!

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/transomjs/transom-core/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/transomjs/transom-core?branch=master)

## Based on many projects you already know!
Transom uses Restify as it's core. We use Passport for authentication, Mongoose for data, SocketIO for realtime updates, Nodemailer for sending emails created with EJS templates!

#### Need something else?
Did we miss your favorite project or something you need for your product? Create a Transom module and let us know about it!

## Extensible
A transom server without modules, is just an empty Restify server. Adding functionality goes quickly with well thought out modules to provide common REST API functions. Features not available in an existing module can be added directly to the (Restify) server as custom routes or rolled into a custom module that can be loaded along-side with other Transom modules.

## Installation
```bash
$ npm install --save @transomjs/transom-core
```

## Usage Example
#### myApi.js
An API definition is quite simply a JavaScript Object. It can be a single file, but it doesn't need to be. Break it up into logical pieces as needed or as your project grows. 
 * Checkout the API definition file from our <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/4umfreak/transom-mongoose-example/blob/master/myApi.js">transom-mongoose-example</a> app.
 
#### index.js
The following simple example is the `index.js` file from a REST API built with Transom. 
* Import the Transom-core and create a new instance.
* Import and configure any Transom modules.
* Import your API definition; This is the metadata that defines your API.
* Call transom.initialize() with your metadata object. It will return a Promise that resolves to your Restify server.
* Call server.listen()

```javascript
// Require your API definition
const myApi = require('./myApi');

// Require the Transom-core and any Transom modules
const Transom = require('@transomjs/transom-core');
const transomMongoose = require('@transomjs/transom-mongoose');

// Instantiate Transom
const transom = new Transom();

// Register and configure Transom modules
transom.configure(transomMongoose, {
  mongodb_uri: 'mongodb://localhost/transom-dev'
});

// Initialize all modules at once, returning a Restify server instance.
transom.initialize(myApi).then(function(server){

	// Add any additional routes as necessary.
	server.get('/hello', function (req, res, next) {
	  res.json({hello: 'world'});
	  next();
	});

	// Add your own Error handlers

	// Start the server!
	server.listen(7000, function () {
		console.log('%s listening at %s', server.name, server.url);
	});
});
```

## Example apps
We've created a few small apis to demonstrate the usage of individual plugins:

## Want to add something before the Transom plugins?
That's easy too. Simply create your own server instance and pass it to Transom after it's been initilized.
```javascript
// Create your own Restify server instance and initialize it as needed.
const server = restify.createServer();
server.use(myCustomPlugin);
// Later, initialize the registered Transom modules.
transom.initialize(server, myApi);
```

## What does the metadata look like?

If you can create [simple JavaScript Objects](https://github.com/4umfreak/transom-mongoose-example/blob/master/myApi.js), you can handle the metadata. By using JavaScript Objects, we can piece together bits of metadata from just about anywhere. 

## Configuring Transom-Core

TransomCore uses attributes from the `transom` node in the definition file to apply defaults on start-up. If you don't need to make any specific configuration changes, the node can be dropped altogether to use the provided defaults.
```javascript
const myApi = {
	transom: {
		requestLogger: {},
		cors: {
			origins: ['http://localhost:8080', 'http://my-dev-server']
		},
		bodyParser: {
			mapParams: true
		},
		queryParser: {
			mapParams: true
		},
		urlEncodedBodyParser: {
			mapParams: true
		},
		gzipResponse: {},
		fullResponse: {},
		favicon: {
			path: "/assets/favicon.ico"
		}
	}
};
```

### TransomCore plugins
The following plugins come standard in a Transom based server because we've found them to be both necessary and useful. Options provided in the definition are passed directly to each plugin unless otherwise documented below. See the documentation on each respective plugin as it's going to be more current than if we copied it here.

If you would prefer not to use any of the individual plugins applied in core, set the corresponding option to false. The following config disables the default `favicon` plugin.
```javascript
const myApi = {
	transom: {
		favicon: false
	}
};
```

#### requestLogger
http://restify.com/docs/plugins-api/#requestlogger

#### cors
https://www.npmjs.com/package/restify-cors-middleware
The `authorization` header is added to the `allowHeaders` option automatically as it's required for Bearer authentication.
The `origins` option is set to a wildcard for easier development and can be set with an environment variable when moving to test or production. Both preflight & actual middleware are applied.

#### bodyParser
http://restify.com/docs/plugins-api/#bodyparser
The `mapParams` option is set to true by default. Many Transom modules will only look for submitted values in req.params, rather than having to check in each of req.query or req.body.

#### urlEncodedBodyParser
A child plugin of the bodyParser. The `mapParams` option is set to true by default.

#### queryParser
http://restify.com/docs/plugins-api/#queryparser The `mapParams` option is set to true by default.

#### gzipResponse
http://restify.com/docs/plugins-api/#gzipresponse

#### fullResponse
http://restify.com/docs/plugins-api/#fullresponse

#### favicon
https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve-favicon
If a `path` option is not provided, an icon will be served from ./node_modules/transom-core/images/favicon.ico.


## Transom modules

Transom modules can be simple middleware, or complex ORM solutions. The following demonstrates how simple a Transom module can really be.

```javascript
function TransomConsole() {
	this.initialize = function(server, options) {
		console.log("Initializing Transom-console.");
		server.use(function(req, res, next) {
			console.log("Transom-console...", req.url);
			next();
		});
	}
}
module.exports = new TransomConsole();
```
